Xanadu is a next generation storage platform technology built for providing a highly scalable, available, consistent and fault tolerant NoSQL data store in a world of Big Data and extreme data resilience. 
Xanadu provides a unique combination of following features.
1. Unlimited Resilient Data Storage Capacity
2. Timeline Data Model 
3. Globally Atomic, Consistent, Isolated and Durable (ACID)

Xanadu implementation is currently split into four parts:
1.	XanaduRFT: The Xanadu implementation that uses the RAFT  distributed consensus protocol for resilient, consistent Key-Value updates in the face of node failure. 
2.	XanaduPX: An updated version, based on XanaduRFT, which uses the PAXOS  distributed consensus protocol instead for Key-Value updates.
3.	XanaduNext: A new implementation of the Xanadu codebase that is refactored to take the best aspects from the above two versions and anticipate the full range of capabilities planned and patented    for the platform.
4.	XanaduRFT (Community): XanaduRFT (Community) is essentially the same as XanaduRFT except it has some limitations to encourage users to use the full XanaduRFT or XanaduPX when moving from prototype applications into production.

Followings illustrate some use cases of Xanadu

Xanadu Big Data DB + Blockchain Integration Demo

Xanadu based Cloud Computing Use Case Demo
Xanadu can be exploited for the back-end storage technology that allows remote client computers can access data and computing/application resources via the standard iSCSI network protocol. With iSCSI supported natively by any operating system, Xanadu makes it easy to securely store and access data from any machine on the network. 
Xanadu can be used for providing services that allow remote computer systems to “boot” from a stored system drive image. 
With diskless units on users’ desks and all data (including the operating system disk) remains in the secure cloud servers, administrators are free to deploy diskless PCs to the desktop with their inherent advantages of higher data security, quicker disaster recovery, smaller office footprint and better energy consumption.
